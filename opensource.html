        <h1>Open Source Software I like</h1>
        <p>My Python program, BinSpaghetti, is open-source.</p>
        <p>Android is technically open-source, however, because of Google's sofwtare ecosystem, it is mostly closed source. However, there are open source Android ROMs such as LineageOS and GrapheneOS.</p>
        <p>Linux is an open-source Unix-like operating system. There are several distros, however, Ubuntu and Manjaro are my recommendations for a beginner. Ubuntu is based off of Debian and Manjaro is based off of Arch.</p>
        <p>Krita is an open-source Photoshop alternative. I prefer it over GIMP because Krita's interface is easier to navigate.</p>
        <p>Bitwarden is an open-source password manager that I use on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is open-source.</p>
        <p>Lots of open-source software can be installed from Github, however, Github is closed-source. The competing Gitlab is open-source and (ironically) you can log into Gitlab using your Github account.</p>
