# Stuff I Have
## Stuff I use frequently
### Laptop
My laptop is a MacBook Air. It has the M1 SOC with 8 CPU cores, 7 GPU cores, 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage, and is currently running macOS 14 Sonoma.

### Steam Deck
I have an LCD Steam Deck with a 512 GB SSD. Normally, I run Bazzite on it, but, unfortunately, I am required to use Windows for a course I am taking.

### Smartphone
My current smartphone is an iPhone 13, which is running iOS 17. However, I have become dissatisfied with iOS again as of late, which is why my next phone will most likely be the Google Pixel 9 Pro.

### Other things
Other things I use frequently include a Keychron K2 keyboard, an Asus ROG Strix Carry mouse, and Apple AirPods Pro 2.

## Stuff I don't use very often
I have a Samsung TV, Dell monitor (I cannot be assed to look for the model names of either one), 2 TB WD MyPassport, Nintendo Wii U, Sony PlayStation 4, Raspberry Pi 1B+, Raspberry Pi Pico, Microsoft Surface RT, Amazon Fire 7, OnePlus 6T, Sharp Aquos Crystal, Samsung Galaxy A03s, Blue Yeti Nano, and Corsair HS60 Pro lying at which don't get much use. In addition, I also have a Nexus 5X, [which is bricked because LG can't make a good phone, like, ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_smartphone_bootloop_issues).
